# Player and Token factions
players control [[Faction|factions]] within this game. each player is in charge of their own faction, these factions can be political (Like the [[Government]] or the [[Revolutionaries]]) or religious ([[Religion]]) 

at the start of the game, all but some [[Population token]]s are [[Neutral]], meaning that they don't belong to any player or their faction. 
in their neutral state, no player can use them for any actions. players must [[Token conversion|convert]] these tokens into their [[#Factions|faction]] in order to use them.

# Tiles and Tile ownership
as explained before, the game is played on a grid of tiles
multiple tokens belonging to multiple factions can exist within the same tile. 
the faction with the most [[Friendly token]]s in that tile, [[Tile Ownership|own]] or control that tile
in the below example, the red player has more [[Friendly token]]s in this tile (tokens that belong to their faction) so they [[Tile Ownership|own]] this tile.

# Religion
other than faction alignments, each token can also believe in one faith or religion. meaning a token can belong to a faction but also believe in another faction's faith or religion. in this case, both the faction leader of the token and the religious leader of that token can control and use this token. but a token can only believe in ***ONE*** religion and belong to ***ONE*** political faction
this mechanic is only used when a player is playing as the [[Religion]] [[#Factions|faction]].

## Tile multi-ownership
if the dominant population of the tile all believe in the same religion, that tile also belongs to the owner of the religion. meaning both the religion player and the political player can [[Building ability|use the buildings]] in that tile or [[Building in a Tile|build]] in that tile.

# NOTICE ! : all religion mechanics are currently WIP and might not stay.
## if at any time, one player controls 80% or more of the entire city's population or tiles. they win.
