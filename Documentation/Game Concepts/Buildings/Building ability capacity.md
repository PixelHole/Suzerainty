once a [[Building]] uses its [[Building ability|ability]] to [[Token Training|train]] a [[Friendly token]], the created [[Special token]] is linked to this building and adds **1** to its capacity.

buildings can only hold a certain number of special tokens and once that number is reached, they can no longer use their ability to train tokens

once a special token that is linked to a building dies or is trained into another special token, it reduces **1** from the buildings capacity, which allows the building to use it's ability again.
