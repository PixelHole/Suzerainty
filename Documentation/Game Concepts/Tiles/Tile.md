every city block in the city, every cell in the game

each tile contains
- a population : the collection of all the population tokens that are on that tile
- 4 [[Building slots]] : slots which the player [[Tile Ownership|in control]] of the tile can build in.
- [[Building]]s : the collection of buildings built on this tile

[[Population token]]s and [[Special token]]s can only exist in these tiles and can only move from one tile to another.
