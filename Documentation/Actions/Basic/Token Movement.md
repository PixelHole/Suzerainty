Player can spend their [[Movement points]] to move their [[Population token]]s around the map. Note that the player can only move population tokens that are [[Token Ownership|under their control]]. meaning they cannot move neutral tokens or tokens belonging to other players (with the exception of the [[Religion]] player).

the amount of points spent per movement is calculated like so :
***Amount of tokens x Tiles travelled***

for example : ***3*** tokens moved ***2*** tiles -> 3 x 2 = 6 movement points spent
