each building has a certain labour cost to build. for example, a building might require 10 labour to fully construct. tokens can be put to work on [[#putting tokens to work|construction duty]] to do the labour required for construction. after all the labour required for building is done or spent, the building is constructed. 

## putting tokens to work
every turn, the player can dedicate any number of [[Friendly token]]s on the [[Tile]] that the [[Building in a Tile|building is being built]] on to work on the construction.

a token that is dedicated to working on construction can no longer do any actions or move, until the construction is finished or the player dismisses them from construction.

being dedicated to construction will count as a token's [[Token ability|action]] and being dismissed from construction will also count as an action. so a token can not be dedicated or dismissed from construction and also perform another action in the same turn.

## labouring
every [[Game Turn|turn]] that a token is in [[#putting tokens to work|construction duty]], it does **One** labour. so for example if a building requires 10 labour to build, it will take :
- 1 token : 10 turns to build
- 2 tokens : 5 turns to build
- 5 tokens : 2 turns to build
- 10 tokens : 1 turn to build

## specialized labour
not all buildings require the same type of labour to build, some buildings are made of wood and some are built of marble. some are tall and elegant and some are short and robust.
specialized labour cannot be completed via regular [[Population token]]s and must be done via [[Special token]]s.

List of all labour types and their required token :
- generic labour : any kind of token
- Masonry labour : [[Stonemason token]]
- Carpentry labour : [[Carpenter token]]
- metalwork labour : [[Metalworker token]]
