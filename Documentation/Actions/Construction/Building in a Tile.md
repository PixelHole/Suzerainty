as long as there are [[Building slots|empty slots]] in a [[Tile]], the player [[Tile Ownership|controlling]] the tile is eligible to build a [[Building]] in that slot.
a player is only able to build buildings that are allowed by their faction. for example, a [[Revolutionaries|Revolutionary]] player cannot build a [[Gendarmerie]], because that building is only allowed to be built by the [[Government]] faction.

every building costs a certain amount of [[Build labour|labour]] to build. to build said building, the player must provide and spend the required labour. you can read more about the labour in [[Build labour]].
